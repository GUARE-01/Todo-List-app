## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- web-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

As this was my first javascript project after learning the basics of javascript,I was finally able to apply all i've learnt and it was fun but challenging.
Firstly, i had to famaliarize my self with the concepts of event bubbling, event capturing and event delegation.
when i was trying to add click event listener to my dynamically created buttons when adding event listeners didn't work.
Secondly,I learnt the how to create a functional light/dark mode toggle which was a very interesting challenge which i thoroughly enjoyed.

### Continued development

For my continued development, I finally understood the concept of mobile first development when i tried optimizing my website for mobile devices.
Moving forward i'll be embracing mobile first development for my next project and also try to advance my knowledge in this.
